# Codalive-SolutionName_SCDFXIBM

# Short description
Our team members are Foon Si Han, Agnes Woo Jie Lyn, Lai Jing Ying Claudia.
Codalive exists because of our common desire to learn something new and exercise our creativity this Covid holiday. 
Our team name is inspired from 'code' and 'alive', which represents our hope that coding technology can help save lives. 
Together, we have learnt to recognise new challenges and trends towards life saving. 
We have also renewed our admiration and respect towards Front Liners, the heroes of SCDF.  
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR WORK! 

# What's the problem? 
Firefighters deal with extreme heat conditions during both training and operations. Their work is physically and mentally demanding. 

Problem statement 2: Climate change

"Climate change is inevitable, with the projected increase in temperatures leading to phenomena such as the Urban Heat Island effect. This leads to an environment and climate where it is increasingly physically challenging for First Responders to train and operate to maximum efficiency and performance. How might SCDF leverage wearables or other technologies to provide relief or enhancement in harsh operating conditions and maximise the safety, health and performance of First Responders during training and operations?"

# How can technology help?
We gather data about firefighters' heart rate and body temperature with sensors. There is potential to make sense of such data via a machine learning process. Optimise training effectiveness. Additional safeguard on the wellbeing of our heroes. 

# The idea
Machine learning. Training. 
Operations. Safety.
